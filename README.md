# VSZipper App
This app zips up vs projects and solutions without unnecessary files/folders like the bin and obj directories

## Installation Instructions

There isn't a way to install it yet.

## Roadmap:
These are the thinks I want to accomplish.
* Zip up a directory and all sub-directories
* Exclude hidden files and folders
* Exclude files and folders I specify (bin/obj/etc)
* Add to right click menu in windows
* Allow for rename of zip file during creation
